Well hello there.

I'm an Ocean Engineer and specialist in hydrodynamics and underwater navigation.

I'm Lauren's other half and Wes's older brother.

I'm helping get the Explorer fleet ready for your summer 2021 deployments,
and planning to chip in wherever I can after that.

My public GitHub handle is [bluesquall](https://github.com/bluesquall)
and you can find my personal site at [mjstanway.com](https://mjstanway.com).
